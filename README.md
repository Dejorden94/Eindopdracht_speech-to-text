# Eindopdracht_speech-to-text

This app converts speech to text and gives a notification when the user is cursing.

To use the app you must clone this repository and save it somewhere on your computer. 

In the ``` var config = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("SubscriptionKey", "Region");``` line you have to enter your subscription key 
from Microsoft Azure and your region (If you are using a trial subscription key you have to enter “westus” at region.)

If you purchased the speech to tekst key you can find you region here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions
